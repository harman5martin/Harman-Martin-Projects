<p> <b> Custom Shell </b>: I built my own custom shell that utilizes systems calls to model how the bash shell works. It also includes a miniture tokenizer and language parser that I built to help the shell parse commands. </p>

<p> <b> Hexadecimal and Parity bit encoders </b>: I made an application that uses mostly bitwise operators to manipulate different ASCII and hexadecimal characters to encode or decode hexadecimal values, as well as encode a parity bit and check for data corruption in the highest order parity bit. </p>

<p> <b> Data Structures </b>: I wrote code to make my own versions of various data structures built into programming languages, such as a binary search tree, linked lists, hash tables, binary heaps, and directed graphs with important graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path. </p>

<p> <b> Pandemic Simulator </b>: I made a user interface application of a pandemic simulator to model the current pandemic we are in. It is interactive to allow a user to change the settings of infection rate, time, etc. It uses multiple threads that run in the background and are manipulated to allow this behavior. </p>

<p> <b> Custom Driver Iterators </b>: I made several custom class iterators to traverse through multiple lists of drivers in my model rideshare app based on certain conditions. This application became useful when selecting drivers more fairly and efficiently. </p>

<p> <b> Model Sushi Boat Restaurant </b>: I made a program that has inherited classes and interfaces that allow you to create different sushi ingredients with specified portions, and then make different pieces of sushi. The program will also output relevant information regarding the different sushi pieces and ingredients. </p>

<p> <b> Model rideshare app/Uber simulator </b>: I made a program that has several classes and interfaces that allows clients to make ride requests and then drivers will go around a city grid to complete those requests and the program outputs information about the completed ride requests. </p>

<p> <b> ASCII art histogram </b>: I made a program that will allow you to input how many bars you want on a histogram and then a set of integer data to the console that will then output a histogram representing that data using ASCII art. </p>

<p> <b> Menu order app </b>: I made an app that will take in user input data to the console to generate ingredients for a restaurant and items ordered by a customer and output information about the menu items and customersâ€™ orders. </p>

<p> <b> Image Filters </b>: I used 2D arrays and mathematical operations to manipulate the pixels in different images to generate filters on the image, such as a brightness or border filter. </p>

<p> <b> Grocery store app </b>: I made an app that will allow a user to input data to the console to generate a store of items and then the app will output information about the items in the store and will also process customer orders and output data regarding their order. </p>

<p> <b> Weather data sorting app </b>: I made an app that will take in a weather data set as a csv and return relevant statistics about it from command line arguments, such as days with rainfall or hottest day. </p>
