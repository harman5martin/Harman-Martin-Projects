<h1> Overview of my Summer 2020 internship with the Joint Special Operations Command </h1>

<p> 
	<h3> About The Internship </h3>
	<p>
	My internship with JSOC was a 12 week long program focused on developing and enhancing software for special operations groups in the military. I part of a small team of developers that adhered to the principles of Agile software development. My team and I focused on developing an app called the Mission Reporting Tool (MRT)

	<h3> About The Mission Reporting Tool (MRT) </h3>
	<p>
	The Mission Reporting Tool (MRT) is a web application desgined to help military adminstrators log mission data and make it easier to analyze. The MRT application made it signficantly easier to track mission data and allow that data to be filtered through chains of command. My team and I worked on several features of MRT that revolutioned data analytics for special operations groups and enabled them to do their job more efficiently.

	<h3> Important Development Contributions </h3>

	<p>
	<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool frontend development </b>: I helped write code in React to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend to interact with the database, to display different report data to users, to log user interaction with the app and sort that data in an organized table for website administrators to see, and helped make a new page for civcas reports (civilian casualties, a special type of report) to be viewed by application users. </p>

	<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool Report logger </b>: I helped write code to process csv files containing data from specific special operations reports, which made inputting reports into the app much more efficient for users. </p>

	<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool backend development and database tables </b>: I helped develop the backend of this application by creating entity classes for report data and using the spring framework to setup controller classes with different REST API endpoints for the web application. I also made several different database tables in MySQL to hold various entity classes for reports to be stored in the applicationâ€™s database. </p>
