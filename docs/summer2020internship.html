<h1> Important contributions and development work during my JSOC internship of summer 2020 </h1>

<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool frontend development (summer 2020 internship) </b>: I helped write code in React to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend to interact with the database, to display different report data to users, to log user interaction with the app and sort that data in an organized table for website administrators to see, and helped make a new page for civcas reports (civilian casualties, a special type of report) to be viewed by application users. </p>

<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool Report logger (summer 2020 internship) </b>: I helped write code to process csv files containing data from specific special operations reports, which made inputting reports into the app much more efficient for users. </p>

<p> <b> Mission Reporting Tool backend development and database tables (summer 2020 internship) </b>: I helped develop the backend of this application by creating entity classes for report data and using the spring framework to setup controller classes with different REST API endpoints for the web application. I also made several different database tables in MySQL to hold various entity classes for reports to be stored in the applicationâ€™s database. </p>
