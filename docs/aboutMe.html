<h1> This page contains some information about me and my personal interests </h1>

I am a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Computer Science B.S. and minoring in Statistics and Analytics B.S. I also am a computer science teaching assistant at UNC. I am seeking a software development internship.

This past summer (2020), I worked as a software engineer interning for the Joint Special Operations Command. I was a full-stack developer working on designing and improving software for special operations groups in the military.

<p>
I work as an umpire for local youth baseball leagues to make extra money to pay for college. I enjoy being around youth baseball and developing my leadership skills as an umpire.

I also do regular landscaping work for my local community to make additional money to pay for college.
